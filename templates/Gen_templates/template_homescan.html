                    <p><strong>SCAN</strong> is an Artificially Intelligent system that prepares itself uniquely for every child so that he can be assessed as per his qualities.

Hence we have come up with a unique system that is embedded with inputs of experts and will also take inputs from teachers that are directly associated with students. </p>
                        <p>Based on these inputs every child is assessed uniquely at regular intervals and it helps in knowing his mistake at early stages and work on them before they turn into his weakness. </p>
